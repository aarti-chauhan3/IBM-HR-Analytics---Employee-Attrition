**1) Project Overview**

This HR Analytics project uses the IBM HR Analytics dataset with 1,470 employee records. We look at why employees leave using SQL, Python and Power BI. Our goal is to provide HR with data-backed recommendations.

|    Metric              | Value |
| Total Employees        | 1,470 |
| Total Attrition        | 237   |
| Retained Employees     | 1,233 |
| Attrition Rate         | 16.12%|


**2) Problem Statement**

The organization has an attrition rate of 16.12% higher than the industry benchmark. We need to understand why employees are leaving.
This project answers:
## Which departments and roles are losing employees?
## Is salary, overtime or career stagnation driving exits?
## What does a high-risk employee profile look like?

**3) Project Workflow**
1️⃣ Data Collection
•	Source: IBM HR Analytics Dataset. Kaggle
•	35 columns covering demographics, compensation, satisfaction, tenure and performance
2️⃣ Excel (Data Exploration)
•	Validated columns and data types
•	Identified null values and inconsistencies
3️⃣ Python (Exploratory Data Analysis)
•	Attrition distribution
•	Age group and gender-based attrition
•	Salary trend visualization
•	Department-wise attrition breakdown
4️⃣ MySQL (Business Analysis) 
•	Structured SQL queries across 4 categories:
•	Attrition Analysis
•	Compensation Analysis
•	Job Satisfaction

**5) Key Business Insights**
**A] Department Attrition**

|      Department	        | Employees Left	| % of Total Attrition |
| Research & Development	|       133       |	      56.12%         |
|       Sales   	        |       92	      |       38.82%         |          
|    Human Resources	    |       12   	    |       5.06%          |

**B] Overtime Impact**

| Overtime Status | Attrition Count | Attrition Rate |
|      Yes        | 127             | **30.5%**      |
|      No         | 110             | **10.4%**      |
   
**C] Salary Gap**

| Employee Status | Avg Monthly Income |
| Left            |       ₹4,787       |
| Stayed          |       ₹6,833       |


**6) SQL Analysis Highlights**
-------- Overtime vs Attrition Rate --------
SELECT OverTime COUNT(*) as attrition_count
FROM hr_analytics
WHERE Attrition = 'Yes'
GROUP BY overtime;

-------- High-Risk Employee Profile --------
SELECT Department, OverTime,
ROUND(AVG(Age),2) as avg_age,
ROUND(AVG(MonthlyIncome),2) as avg_income,
COUNT(*) as attrition_count
FROM hr_analytics
WHERE Attrition = 'Yes'
GROUP BY Department, Overtime
ORDER BY attrition_count DESC;


## Top Recommendations

### Priority 1. Salary Correction
Fix salaries for Lab Technicians, Research Scientists and Sales Representatives.

### Priority 2. Overtime Management
Manage overtime for high-risk departments.

### Priority 3. Sales Executive Culture Audit
Investigate management quality and growth ceiling for Sales Executives.

## High-Risk Employee Profile
